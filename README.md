# ReactJS Weather app
A simple applicaton that determines the temprature, humidity etc. of any city. 

First, the final product!

I'd like to shout out @sentdex on YouTube for an amazing guide that I used to create this.


## Technologies used
- Javasript (ReactJS)
- CSS
- Open Weather Map [API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Data Source
- Quandl
- Yahoo Finance

## Major Features
- Backtesting strategy after a train and validation 
- Comparing return to the market average

## Machine Learning Framework

The code followed the framework for almost all machine learning processes. 
1. Data Collection: the data was pulled using a scraper that would use regular expressions to strip data from yahoo html files, the amazing Quandl API helped fill in the rest of the data

2. Data Preparation: Using the SKLearn library on python, the data was randomized and split int training and evaluation sets. An additional script was used to fill in missing values

3. Model: Linear Support Vector Classification

4. Train: 0 for underperforming stocks, 1 for outperforming stocks. A simple function call from the SKLearn library 

5. Evaluate: Compares the return of the stocks chosen to the return of the S&P 500.

6. Parameter Tuning: More of an artform, test size was manipulated, features were added and removed. Feature weighting was a little hard for my first Machine learning algorithm.

7. Predict and Test: Used a very basic backtester to measure the return if the algorithm was used. On average the predictions were 56% correct. This may not seem bad but it's unknown. The problem is if you are right 56% of the time, if the losses from the other 44% outweigh the gains made, then the algorithm was unsuccessful. Overall, the algo outperformed the S&P 500 by 9% which is actually pretty good (and probably unrealistic)!


## Future Implementation 
- Automate data pull to update weekly 
- Use techincal signals 
- A more in-depth backtester 
- Future week prediction
